Free bootcamp by Digital Innovation One. Learning to create applications with Java and Angular from scratch. March-June 2022.

# Project #1: Mario Run Game with HTML, CSS and Javascript
I tweaked the model provided by the instructor, changing images, intervals and sizes to remake the game with the Super Mario theme. I also added a score, shown at the top of the screen and at Game Over.
